Assignment 2: Colour Trees
--------------------------

All submitted work must be *done individually* without consulting someone else's solutions in accordance with the University's [Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism](https://sydney.edu.au/students/academic-dishonesty.html) policies.

## Story

We are asked to design a tree capable of storing a certain propagating colour. Which colour is propagated is determined by the colours sorted in its subtree. There is a hierarchy of colours, and an ordering exists to determine which is the dominating colour that will be propagated. This tree is used to do some elemental property checking to run some "what if" scenarios.

Informally, our implementation should support the following:

* Update the colour of a node.
* Insert a new node.
* Swap two subtrees. This is intended to help us answer questions such as "What changes to the propagating colors if the descendants were different?".
* **Property checking**: Given a node, does every descendant (up to k levels deeper) of this node have a certain color.

### About the tree

The tree contains a colour propagation, based on the hierarchy:

1. RED (R)
2. GREEN (G)
3. BLUE (B)
4. CYAN (C)
5. YELLOW (Y)

With **RED** being the strongest colour.

The tree:

```
   Y
  / \
 C   G
  \   \
  R    Y
```

Will produce the propagations:

```
   R
  / \
 R   G
  \   \
  R    Y
```

## Code

You are asked to implement 2 major files, `node.py` and `tree.py`.

### node.py

This is the implementation of an element in the tree, or a node of the tree.

**Properties**

* `colour` - The colour of the node.
* `propagated_colour` - The colour that has been propagated.
* `parent` - A pointer to the parent node, `None` if it is the root.
* `children` - A list of pointers to the children of this node.

#### Functions

**set_parent(self, parent: 'Node') -> None**

Sets the parent of the node, takes a parent Pointer (type Node).

**update_colour(self, colour: Colour) -> None**

Updates/Changes the colour of the node, by setting the `colour` attribute and performing any relevant calculations for that node.

**add_child(self, child_node: 'Node') -> None**

Adds the `child_node` to the list of children for the node.

**remove_child(self, child_node: 'Node') -> None**

Removes the `child_node` from the list of children of this node.


### Tree

This is the tree implementation, and where most of the interaction will come from.

**Properties**

* `root` - A pointer to the root node of the tree.

#### Functions

**update_node_colour(self, n: Node, new_colour: Colour) -> None**

Updates the colour of the given node `n` with the colour `new_colour`.
Should also perform any *relevant actions* relating to the tree.

**put(self, parent: Node, child: Node) -> None**

Adds a node into the tree, by adding `child` to `parent`.
This should also perform any relevant calculations that are required.

**rm(self, child: Node) -> None**

Removes the child from the tree.
**PLEASE NOTE** if this node has children, they are removed at the same time, we can consider this entire subtree rooted at this `child` node removed from the tree.

**swap(self, subtree_a: Node, subtree_b: Node) -> None**

Swaps the tree rooted at `subtree_a` with the tree rooted at `subtree_b` and performs any relevant calculations.

**is_coloured_to_depth_k(self, start_node: Node, colour: Colour, k: int) -> bool**

Perform the property checks to see whether all nodes in the subtree (up and including level `k` starting from the start node) have the same colour!

**is_colour_until_condition(self, start_node: Node, colour_a: Colour, colour_b: Colour) -> Tuple[bool, List[Node]]:**

Checks whether the subtree rooted at `start_node` has colour_a until colour_b in all paths.
We are checking the property: "In subtree rooted at start_node, is every path colour_a until colour_b?"
If this condition fails, you must provide a path (given in the form of a list starting from `start_node` to the failing node) as a "witness" to ensure that your answer is correct.


## Testing

We have provided you with some test cases in the `tests` directory of this
repository. We will be using unit tests provided with the `unittest` package
of python.

**Running Tests**

From the base directory (the one with `node.py` and `tree.py`), run

```
python -m unittest -v tests/test_sample_tree.py tests/test_sample_node.py
```

Or, running all the tests by:

```
python -m unittest -vv
```

## Marking

You will be marked using a range of public and hidden tests.
There will **not** be additional tests added after the due date.

All tests are **between 1 to 5 marks each**.
